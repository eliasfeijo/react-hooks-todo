# React Hooks Todo

I created this application to learn more about React Hooks and Functional Components, specifically the useContext Hook.

## Development

- Open a terminal and `cd` into the project's directory
- Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
- Run `yarn start` to start the development server, it will open the application in your default browser

## Credits

This application was made in a single night by me, **Elias Feij√≥**.

The main technologies used are:

- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + PostCSS 8
- Webpack 5 + Babel
- Node.js

And many more libraries and bits. Check out the [package.json](package.json) for details.
